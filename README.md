# AdvancedChatModuleTemplate

This repository serves as a way to view use cases of AdvancedChatCore's code, and allow for easy module creation using this repository as a base. To get started clone the project and rename all the necessary files.

## Development

To develop, all dependencies should automatically be processed through gradle. Make sure to update Core and other dependencies. To ensure code consistency the hook pre-commit.sh can be used (not required). To install the pre-commit hook run:

`ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`
